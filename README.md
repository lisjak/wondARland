## About
wondARland is a cross-platform mobile AR escape/adventure-style game that uses Viro-React’s library to create AR elements in addition to utilizing React, React-Native, Redux, React-Router-Native, and game development theory. It also features Firebase and Cloud Firestore intergration. Users navigate through ‘adventurescapes’ -- immersive scenes created using 360-degree photos and videos, as well as 3D graphics and text -- by using their camera’s on-screen viewfinder and by physically entering through 3D portals. Users are then able to venture through and interact with augmented reality by physically moving around in their real-world setting. As they fall deeper down the rabbit hole, users collect hearts and roses as they search for the hidden passcodes in hopes of ultimately escaping before time runs out! 

Be careful of getting lost in wondARland -- we’re all mad here! wondARland is a testament to teamwork and how far you can come in learning new technologies in just a few weeks with hard work, perseverance, extensive planning, communication, lots of documentation reading and tons of experimentation.
